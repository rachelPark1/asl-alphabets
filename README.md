# ASL Alphabets
This is a flashcard app that implements spaced repetition and allows users to memorize the American Sign Language alphabet handshapes more easily.

A user can press either "I know this" or "I don't know this" after seeing the given hand shapes; when the user presses the "I don't know this" button, that particular handshape will show up again based on the algorithm I built. He/she can also check the answers by clicking "Answer," and the correct alphabet will show next to the "Answer" button. If the user wishes to look up the letter, he/she can press the "Search" button, which will take the user to a Google website that has already searched the particular letter for the user.
